# nextjs-template

Just a basic template to bootstrap my [NextJS](https://nextjs.org/) projects.

It has:
- Everything under an `src` directory
- Absolute imports on `src` configured on `jsonconfig.json`
- prettier included with the config that I like
- sensible .gitignore
- add `normalize.css` imported as a global with custom app component
- basic layout on its own component
